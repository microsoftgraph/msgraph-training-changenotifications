# Microsoft Graph Training Module - Using Change Notifications and Track Changes with Microsoft Graph

This module will introduce you to working with change notifications (webhooks) & track changes (delta query) in the Microsoft Graph.

This module is based on the following Microsoft Learn module: [Use Change Notifications and Track Changes with Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msgraph-changenotifications-trackchanges)

## Lab - Change Notifications and Track Changes with the Microsoft Graph

The lab for this module is available in multiple units within the associated Microsoft Learn module. Use the following links to jump to the specific unit. Each Microsoft Learn unit represents a different lab exercise & demo in the presentation.

1. [Exercise: Azure AD apps .NET core web APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/msgraph-changenotifications-trackchanges/3-exercise-create-app)

   In this exercise, you'll create a new Azure AD app registration using the Azure AD admin center and grant administrator consent to the required permission scopes.

1. [Exercise: Microsoft Graph change notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/msgraph-changenotifications-trackchanges/5-exercise-change-notifications)

   In this exercise, you'll extend the existing ASP.NET console application to receive notifications from Microsoft Graph subscriptions. The notifications are sent after a subscription is successfully created, requesting Microsoft Graph to notify an endpoint when specified entities are created, updated, or deleted.

1. [Exercise: Microsoft Graph track changes (delta query)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/msgraph-changenotifications-trackchanges/7-exercise-track-changes)

   In this exercise, you'll learn how to use the track changes capability in Microsoft Graph. The track changes capability (delta query), enables applications to get a list of all items that have been added, updated, or deleted since the last time the same query was issued.
